## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model
building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from
data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
<br>
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through 
experience. It is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being 
explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is 
difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

## Why Machine Learning?
Data is the lifeblood of all business. Data-driven decisions increasingly make the
difference between keeping up with competition or falling further behind. Machine learning
can be the key to unlocking the value of corporate and customer data and enacting decisions
that keep a company ahead of the competition.

## Introductory Videos :pen:
[Introduction to AI and ML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMUxmLyrhSk) - no
need to watch full video for now just go through basic intuition

## What to start with First?
* <b> Mathematics -</b> Linear algebra , Integral calculus , differential calculus , partial
derivatives,Matrices and Determinants , Combinatorics.
* <b> Probability and Statistics - </b> Various distributions , Mean , Variance,
hypothesis and other topics. You can refer 
[this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VSZtNYMntM) in order to practise these topics



<!--<b> 1) ) ML + Python (scikit-learn) </b>
The programming languages used in machine learning are Python, Matlab, R. Python if a most 
popular language for machine learning. There are various python libraries used in machine 
learning but the 5 most important and frequently used ones are

* Scipy
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Sklearn

<b> 2) ML + Weka (no code) </b>
Weka is a software which can be used to work on machine learning algorithms without use of 
any programming language. Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data 
mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own 
Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, 
association rules, and visualization.

##  To Setup Your Python Environment for Machine Learning with Anaconda

Follow [this](https://machinelearningmastery.com/setup-python-environment-machine-learning-deep-learning-anaconda/)

Anaconda navigator provides information about various Ide that can be used for working on 
machine learning projects. The most common text editor used for writing machine learning code in python is <b>Jupyter</b>(if you want to work in offline mode) and <b>Google Colab</b>(for online working). 
Google Colab 
is a cloud based environment product by google for working with python projects

## What should I use for Python ?
Setup Anaconda Environment has many inbuilt libraries in it . Using Jupyter Notebook which comes alongside with Jupyter notebook is recommended. [Stepwise tutorial](https://youtu.be/EGaw6VXV3GI)

## After basics time to start with important libraries
* [Numpy](https://youtu.be/GB9ByFAIAH4)
* [Pandas](https://youtu.be/ZyhVh-qRZPA?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS)
* [Matplotlib](https://youtu.be/yZTBMMdPOww)
* [Seaborn](https://youtu.be/TLdXM0A7SR8)
* [Plotly and Cufflinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPznsxeL3FM&list=PLH6mU1kedUy9HTC1n9QYtVHmJRHQ97DBa)

Use the line of code “pip install” or “conda install” to download any necessary libraries.
It is a really good practice to solve real world problems along with these libraries.There are
some other libraries too. But for now this is enough in creating ML algorithm
