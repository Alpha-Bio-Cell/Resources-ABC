<h2 align="center">Why should I learn app dev </h1>
<p>If getting to know the inner workings of mobile doesn‚Äôt interest you, here‚Äôs why you should 
learn application development:</p>

* Opportunities for new, innovative apps are always up for grabs. If you have a great app 
idea and are not sure about how to implement it or don‚Äôt have funds to hire a freelancer, 
you can make your own application. Who knows, you could even be the next Instagram 
or Snapchat!

* App Developers are highly sought after. You could always freelance as an app 
developer and charge clients for building apps for them.

* Mobile applications get high revenue from app stores and in-app advertisements with 
minimal cost price. Developing apps is a good way to make money if you know what 
you‚Äôre doing!
