Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google used for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for
[mobile](https://flutter.dev/docs), [web](https://flutter.dev/web) and [desktop](https://flutter.dev/desktop) from a single codebase. Flutter apps are written in the Dart language. Dart syntax is easy to understand for JavaScript or Java developers as it supports most of the object-oriented concepts.
