# Artificial Intelligence 

When I say Artificial Intelligence people usually think it’s same as Machine Learning. And 
that is because Machine Learning forms a major chunk of what Artificial Intelligence is. But 
since Machine Learning is covered separately, I will write about some of the parts of AI that 
do not fall under Machine Learning.

Artificial Intelligence as a whole is basically when a computer/computer system seems to be 
autonomous and acting upon its own intelligence. But essentially what it’s doing is following 
a set of rules in every possible case. Parts of AI that do not come under ML are Expert Systems 
that under the hood is essentially a bunch of if…else and switch cases which is rapidly declining 
in use cases due to increased complexity for bigger models, although it works well for smaller 
systems.

To get started with AI without getting into the ML parts of it, all you need is good logical 
thinking, and a strong hold over any one programming language (preferably python). 
Additionally, for tasks like web mining and scraping a thorough knowledge of RegEx is 
beneficial.
The perks of learning AI are that it can be used to automate tasks that are repetitive, thus making 
lives easier. It can be used a quick fix instead of ML during Hackathons when working on 
smaller use cases. It is the stepping stone towards Robotics.
