# PCB DESIGN


## What is PCB Design?
In simple terms PCB design is the design of electronic circuits using semiconductors and other electronic components so that they may be printed on a board of small size. The term PCB stands for 'Printed Circuit Board'. <br> There are various softwares available such as Proteus, Altium and Autodesk Eagle. <br> This is a great skill to learn if you are interested in the design of intricate circuits used in robots, drones and other gadgets.

## Whys should I learn PCB Design?
It is an important skill that many electrical and electronics engineers use to make complex circuits that by hand would take days to complete. With this we can do the whole job in a matter of hours. <br> Basically, PCB is the foundation of electronics. Without a Printed circuit board no one can make a electronics product. Consider any electronic product that you are using in your day to day life. It may be a mobile phone or a laptop, television or whichever the product is , you can see a printed circuit in it. <br> Only few colleges teach PCB Design in our country. This makes the particular field less competitive and you can easily differentiate yourself from the crowd and get a job.The reason why people donâ€™t choose PCB Design as a career option is the wrong perception and lack of awareness. 

## How long does it take to learn PCB Design?
It does j=not take long to learn how to use the software. The software requires around 5-6 hours total to learn. The skill that you mainly require is the knowledge on how to design suitable circuits for the product you are making. That knowledge comes with experience and learning in the field of electronics. You will need to learn the basics of electronics and ehat components are used to design specific circuits.

## What softwares are we supposed to use?
Now, there are various softwares that are used to design PCBs. They are Altium Designer, Proteus, OrCAD and Autodesk. OrCAD and Proteus are older softwares but are still used professionally. Altium Designer is the industry standard use software. It is more advanced than the others and should only be used if you have experience designing PCBs. Autodesk Eagle is the most popular software for beginners that you can still use professionally. It has an easy to understand interface and is beginner friendly.
